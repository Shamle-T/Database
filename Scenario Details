Scenario Details 

You have been hired to design a database for a toy shop business. The following are details about 
how this toy shop operates:

• Customer details must be recorded. This includes a customer number, first name, last name, 
email address and password.

• The store wishes to implement a “referral system” to reward customers who tell 
others about the store. Therefore, customer details should also include a “referrer” column, 
which will contain the customer number of the customer who referred them, if applicable 
(not all customers are referred by someone).

• Customers can define addresses which are stored in the database. A customer can define 
multiple addresses, and each address is associated with a single customer via their customer 
ID number. As well as specifying the address itself, customers can specify a name for the 
address, e.g. “Home”. An address ID number is used to identify each address.

• Details of item suppliers must be recorded (i.e. the sources of the items that they sell). This 
includes a supplier ID number, business name, phone number and website URL.

• Details of products must be recorded. This includes an item ID number, name, description, 
price (how much the store sells it for), cost (how much it costs the store to buy) and stock 
(how many of the item the store currently has available).

• The store keeps track of the supplier of each product. Products only have one 
supplier.

• A list of item categories must be recorded, and the database must keep track of which items 
are in which categories. All items are in at least one category, but can be in several of them.

• The only category details required are a category ID number and a category name.

• Details of orders made by customers must be recorded. This includes an invoice ID number, 
the date/time of the order, a delivery address and a billing address, as well as the customer 
ID number of the customer who made the order.

• For each order, the database must record details of ordered products (i.e. which products 
were included in the order) and the quantity ordered. Each order must contain at least one 
item.

• The toy shop has decided to start doing limited time special events. Each event has a name, 
a start date/time and an end date/time. The store offers a percentage discount to all orders 
made during the event (that is all orders with an order date that occurs after the event’s 
start date and before the event’s end date) which the database will need to keep track of
